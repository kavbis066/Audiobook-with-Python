# Audiobook-with-Python

Required libraries:
pyttsx3, pdfplumber, PyPDF2

## Note: In case the pyttsx3 default installed version doesn't work, install the lower version for python 3.x. It had happened with me, when I executed the code I was not getting the output (the speech), so I downgraded the version of pyttsx3.
